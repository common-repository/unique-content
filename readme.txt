<strong>How this plugin actually works</strong>

This WordPress plugin is very powerful tool that using an external API which is built on Nodejs. Nodejs tool goes to Youtube using video id and check if the video has Captions CC, if yes then it scrapes all the captions and remove timestamps, join all words line by line and returns raw text. Very powerful tool, isn’t it ?
